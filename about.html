<section class="about">
  <p class="first">I'm Anthony Candaele, a web developer that is in the web for more then a decade now.</p>
  <p>What I've learned during all those years is that websites work best when they are simple to use.</p>
  <p>Therefore a good design process is crucial, it is based on an intense collaboration between me and the customer, and it should translate the customer's business goals into a clear and easy to use web user interface.</p>
  <p>Although a website should be clear and easy to use, building one is certainly not. Today there are a lot of 'off the shelve solutions' that build your website, so to speak, with a push of the button.</p>
  <p>If there is anything I learned, it is that building a successfull website is hard work! There are a lot of concerns to take into account, like Search Engine Optimization, Speed optimization, User Experience, Responsiveness.</p>
  <p>But don't let this scare you off, that's why I am here for, isn't it? Through extensive testing we'll get our website just the way we want it to be!</p>
